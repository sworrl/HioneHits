/**
 * HiBy's direct V4L2 hooks on /dev/radio0, wrapped so a missing or renamed native never takes
 * the tuner down with it.
 *
 * These live in the same `qcom.fmradio.jar` as the HCI API but are HiBy additions, so they are
 * resolved at runtime from the framework and could in principle not exist on a future build.
 * Every call here reports unavailability as null/false rather than throwing, and each distinct
 * failure is logged exactly once so a broken hook is visible without flooding logcat.
 *
 * The important one is [setMute]. The HiBy driver comes up muted and `FmReceiver.setMuteMode()`
 * does not clear it: that goes over HCI to the FM core, while the audio actually passes through
 * the V4L2 layer's own mute. Stock FM2 mutes here while it builds the route and unmutes 300 ms
 * later, which is also where its lack of a power-on pop comes from.
